# Gemini UI Prompt

Design a public YouTube collection web UI with two screens for public users (List and Detail), plus an admin Login screen. The list must show thumbnail-first cards (not text-only) and include title, tags, category, and a 1–5 rating. Sorting controls: Added date (newest), Publish date (future), Rating (high). The detail page must show title, thumbnail, a clickable YouTube URL, tags, category, rating, and Markdown-rendered sections for “Good Points” and “Memo”.

Login screen requirements: show a single “Sign in with Google” action, brief helper text about admin-only access, and a minimal layout that still matches the overall visual theme. Include a subtle lock/admin indicator without making it feel heavy.

Visual direction: YouTube-friendly and highly readable with a soft, eye-friendly light-red theme. Prioritize clarity and scannability like a video library. Use gentle contrast, generous spacing, and clear typography hierarchy. Base the background and components on pale red/pink tints with soft neutrals; avoid purple bias and avoid dark-mode bias. Define a cohesive color palette and CSS variables. Use rounded, calm UI parts with subtle borders and mild shadows to reduce visual strain. Keep admin actions (Add/Edit/Delete) as small utility buttons. Ensure responsive layout for mobile and desktop. Avoid generic boilerplate layouts.
